<p>OK. Probably a mistake, but I thought it might be fun to turn a few of the poems from <em><a title="Calenday" href="http://laurenhaldeman.com/calenday-is-a-book/">Calenday</a></em> into comics. It has been years since I drew comics. I stopped doing them after I realized that being able to draw a comic doesn't, in fact, single-handedly secure you a life-partner (even though I was absolutely sure it would).</p>
<p>The first comic I started working on is from a poem in <em>Calenday</em> called 'Jealous.'</p>
<p>I worked on sketching out the panels for each line, first. How do you even figure out what to draw? Then, I gathered enough time and energy to ink them, and then I erased the pencil lines. That's where I am at right now. Here are a few shots of the slow progress.</p>

<p>Mind you, this took me about two full <em>months</em>, because</p>
<p>1. I only have 8.5 minutes <em>a day</em> to do this (after E goes to sleep and before I go to sleep) and</p>
<p>2. Making comics is hard! I thought it would be stupid easy. It is not.</p>
<p>Next steps will be scanning them into the computer and pounding my head against Photoshop to add color. And then the world will be mine! My comics will launch me into complete serenity and a state of absolute power. Just you wait.</p>
