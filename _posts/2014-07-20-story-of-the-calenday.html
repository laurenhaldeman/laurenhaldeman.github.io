<p>I wrote this book in fragments, mostly during the first year that my daughter was born. Exhausted, confused, and utterly out of my mind, I bought a tiny Moleskin 'daily planner' set of 12 notebooks, one for each month of the year, and tried to write something -- anything -- on each day's page. Most of the entries went like this:</p>
<p>"Why do I have so much acne? There is so much acne on my face it hurts to even talk about the acne."</p>
<p>Or just "Angry. "</p>
<p>It was a calendar of sorts, but, it also just felt like one long day. Sometimes, rarely, I would write what resembled a poem. Near the end of that first year, probably on one of the days I wasn't crying, I decided to make a tumblr account to archive the few poems from the notebook. I tried to pick the url 'calendar.tumblr.com', (I was so tired I literally could not think of anything else to call it) but it was taken. So that led me to 'calenday'.</p>
<p>The poems in Calenday divide themselves into two parts: the birth of my daughter and the death of my brother. The first part contains short, quick poems that catalogue the utter madness involved in creating, birthing and then living with a human child. These are the poems that were salvaged from the notebook, titled only by the day they were written.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">Making a baby<br />
is strange: how a golden fish<br />
dies in a cave full of<br />
plasma — &amp; pretty soon there’s this<br />
huge crying computer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These poems travel the sleep-deprived, hallucinogenic landscape of parenting a newborn -- from the otherworldly process of giving birth,</p>
<blockquote><p>I cried because your head came out of my body. Your whole body came out of my body &amp; it was nuts. It was absolutely insane.</p></blockquote>
<p>to the strangeness of extra-physical connection,</p>
<blockquote><p>the child bends, / syncing, towards the loading mom-skull. People here call this / the ‘neon whisper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-21191 size-full" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/1453279_10101806159039749_1316022664_n-e1412714394701.jpg" alt="ryan fire" width="200" height="132" /> The second part of Calenday is a set of poems about my brother, Ryan, who was murdered in Denver in 2012. These poems act as a sort of working grief machine -- they were actually used as <em>tools</em> during my early grieving to help me process what happened. I am not sure if they assisted in 'healing' anything, but they helped me to tell my brain that Ryan was dead. They helped me calmly, gently, over and over, to tell my brain what had happened, and that my brother Ryan was dead now. Maybe this nudged my brain to start to acclimating to the new reality, so that it wasn't such a shock each time that I remembered? I don't know. But they helped. And I thank them for that. I thank the poems.</p>
<p>The poems -- confused, dark, anxious, sad, deeply bewildered -- also somehow exist kindly and benevolently with the earlier pieces about my daughter. This relationship reveals itself as a wonder -- I would have never guessed the poems would be friends.</p>
