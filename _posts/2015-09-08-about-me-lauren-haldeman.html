I’m Lauren Haldeman. I am the author of the poetry collection <em>Calenday</em> (Rescue Press, 2014). I work as the web developer, web designer and editor for this website, as well as several other websites, including the Writing University website at the University of Iowa and the Iowa Review. I received my M.F.A. from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, and have been a finalist for the Walt Whitman award and the Colorado Prize for Poetry. Also: I’m a mom and make paintings.</p>

I played semi-professionally all through high school, on three different teams. When I was 17, I had a collision with a goalie and lost the PCL in my right knee. It took a long time to heal and begin playing again.</p>
