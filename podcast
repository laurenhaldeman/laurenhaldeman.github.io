        <h1 class="large">Sad Me of the Past</h1>
        <h1 class="large">Sad Me of the Past is a podcast by the Writing University, the Magid Center for Writing and the Iowa Young Writers' Studio. In this podcast we invite an established writer to revisit a piece they wrote in their tender years that fills them with affection, regret, nostalgia, embarrassment, relief, delight, all of the above, or something else entirely. Just as an infant must take those early, brave, awkward steps when learning to walk, we writers must make our own early, brave, awkward efforts as we set out on the journey of mastering our craft. We travel back to that ancient time when we were bursting with hubris or scared to death; enraptured by language or paralyzed by it; determined to become a writer or terrified that we didn't have the stuff.</span>
