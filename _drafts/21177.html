<p>The cover for <em>Calenday</em> came from a painting I finished over the 2014 winter, during the bleak months in Iowa when we go craft/art/project crazy in our smaller and smaller house. Sometimes E and I would paint in the basement together -- and by this I mean sometimes I would try to paint in the basement and E would paint <em>on top of what I was painting</em> in the basement -- so that didn\'t quite work.</p>
<p>I would love to write the sentence: "Therefore every morning I would wake before the dawn to meticulously work on the details, sipping tea from a wooden cup and watching the sun rise through a prism", but that sentence would be a lie. I tried once ONCE to wake up very early and paint, but I am so bad at waking up early, and the rest of the day felt scary. Time was all messed up, I was really thirsty (??) and I fell asleep at 5:30 pm. So the rest of the painting work had to be done in secret bursts during normal business hours.</p>
<p>I wanted to do backdrop paintings of the Appalachian mountains, because I miss them, because I have reoccurring dreams about them and who has reoccurring dreams about mountains? So to unhaunt (de-haunt?) my head, I found some images and began.</p>
<p>The work is all acrylic (I am afraid of oil paints) on wood paneling. The wood panel was cheap from Dick Blick, nice and smooth and smelling like wood. After finishing, I created a sort of frame out of 1x1 pieces of wood and glued it on the back. So now it looks like a real framed-ish painting.</p>
<p>I had planned on selling the painting, but like everything I make, I liked it too much and so will selfishly keep it.</p>

<p>But I would happily send out a color digital art print to any one who bought the book. So post a picture of yourself holding the book on Facebook or Twitter, tag me in it (FB: http://facebook.com/wlftn | Twitter: @laurenhaldeman) and I will send you the print for free!</p>
