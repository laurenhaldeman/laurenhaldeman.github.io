<p>September 5, 2010 - 10 weeks old.</p>
<p>We are at home in Virginia. My mom is helping me with you. I wanted to write out all of the things that I am worried about, because otherwise they just go over and over in my head.</p>
<p>I AM WORRIED</p>

<li>That I will make a mistake &amp;Â hurt you or lose you.</li>
<li>That you aren't happy.</li>
<li>That I am going crazy.</li>
<li>That I will get further from my family/ not live near them.</li>
<li>That society will break down.</li>
<li>That I will somehow hurt you/lose you.</li>
<li>That Ben and I will lose our jobs.</li>
<li>That you will get sick or brain damaged.</li>
<li>That my body and my mind are breaking down.</li>
<li>That spiders will hurt you.</li>
<li>That bad spirits will hurt you.</li>
<li>That my family won't get enough time with you.</li>
<li>That I am bad at my job.</li>
<li>That I don't have enough skills.</li>
