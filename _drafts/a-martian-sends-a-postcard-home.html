<p align="RIGHT">Craig Raine, 1979</p>
<p>Caxtons are mechanical birds with many wings<br />
and some are treasured for their markings--</p>
<p>they cause the eyes to melt<br />
or the body to shriek without pain.</p>
<p>I have never seen one fly, but<br />
sometimes they perch on the hand.</p>
<p>Mist is when the sky is tired of flight<br />
and rests its soft machine on the ground:</p>
<p>then the world is dim and bookish<br />
like engravings under tissue paper.</p>
<p>Rain is when the earth is television.<br />
It has the properites of making colours darker.</p>
<p>Model T is a room with the lock inside --<br />
a key is turned to free the world</p>
<p>for movement, so quick there is a film<br />
to watch for anything missed.</p>
<p>But time is tied to the wrist<br />
or kept in a box, ticking with impatience.</p>
<p>In homes, a haunted apparatus sleeps,<br />
that snores when you pick it up.</p>
<p>If the ghost cries, they carry it<br />
to their lips and soothe it to sleep</p>
<p>with sounds. And yet, they wake it up<br />
deliberately, by tickling with a finger.</p>
<p>Only the young are allowed to suffer<br />
openly. Adults go to a punishment room</p>
<p>with water but nothing to eat.<br />
They lock the door and suffer the noises</p>
<p>alone. No one is exempt<br />
and everyone's pain has a different smell.</p>
<p>At night, when all the colours die,<br />
they hide in pairs</p>
<p>and read about themselves --<br />
in colour, with their eyelids shut.</p>
