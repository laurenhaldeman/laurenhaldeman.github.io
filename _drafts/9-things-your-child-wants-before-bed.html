<p>Is your child not going to sleep? That's because she needs ten things. Just give your child these ten things &amp; she will instantly go to sleep. It is that easy!</p>
<p>1. <strong>A stuff animal.</strong> No, not the stuffed animal she already has. Another one, specifically "the" other one. No, not that one! Why would you even bring that one into the room!?</p>
<p>2. <strong>Milk.</strong> Just one sip. Out of the blue cup. Well, then clean it. And your child wants to hold it. Just let her hold it. But this milk is too cold. Could you put it in the microwave for, like, 4 seconds? Ohp, 4 seconds was too long. Now it needs an ice cube or something.</p>
<p>3. <strong>No ice cube.</strong> Sorry -- we were wrong about the ice cube. Just get the milk back to the way it was before the ice cube. And you'll need to wash that cup again.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Tickle back.</strong> This is a really nice way to bond with your child. Just tickle your child's back for a few minutes as she eases into sleep. Now her arm -- just tickle her arm. Now the other one. She wants both legs tickled now, so sure, tickle those. With your nails, not your fingertips! Faster. Faster, but softer. That's too soft. Now tickle her stuffed animal. You heard her: tickle the stuffed animal. What? What's weird about that?</p>
<p>5. <strong>Broccoli.</strong> As a parent, you should have one really good rule in place -- if your child wants food at bedtime, all she can have is steamed broccoli. It is a win-win! So get her that steamed broccoli. And yes, she will want to eat it in the bed. That's totally fine, but, of course, you can't be in the room. Well, because she wants her privacy. Just leave her alone, on the bed, with the plate of steamed broccoli. What? It is a simple request.</p>
<p>6. <strong>Another plate of broccoli.</strong> Well, that was fast. What happened to the first plate? Better get on it -- a growing child can't have too much broccoli.</p>
<p>7. <strong>Grandma.</strong> Now she wants her grandma. What do you mean Grandma's not here? But she was JUST HERE. She was just here a few months ago! Where did she go? Seriously, where the F*** did she go? Virginia?! Back to Virginia? Your child WANTS HER GRANDMA. This is a no-brainer! Get Grandma.</p>
<p>8. <strong>The present.</strong> OK, if she can't have Grandma, then at least give her the present that grandma brought her a few month ago. We're sorry -- we weren't clear-- not the OPENED gift, but the wrapped gift, back in time, before your child knew what the gift was. Just go back and make it so that she doesn't know what the present is &amp; Grandma just brought it &amp; it is still wrapped and everything. What's the hold up?</p>
<p>9. <strong>Tissues</strong>. Well. Look at that. It seems your child's nose is stuffed up from all the crying. Bring her a few tissues, won't you, and teach her how to blow her nose. No, this isn't a skill "you're just born with." Show her how <em>you</em> do it, then have <em>her</em> do it. OK, that was close --  but this time have her blow with her mouth closed. Good, good, but now have her blow OUT, not suck IN. With her mouth closed! Easy now, calm down...remember,<em> </em>who is the adult here? Y<em>ou can't blow her nose for her.</em>  Let's be reasonable about this. Maybe you should just let her shred up the tissues. That might solve things. And once all the tissues have been shredded up, just put them on those two empty broccoli plates.</p>
