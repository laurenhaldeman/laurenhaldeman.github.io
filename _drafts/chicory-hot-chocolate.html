<p>About a month ago, my eyelids started twitching at work. I ignored it at first, who wouldn't? But then they KEPT TWITCHING. And I thought, in the deep whispering truth part of my brain, "this is because of coffee." Like any addict, I didn't want to believe it, so I blamed it on dry-eye, stress, my computer screen, allergies. It may have had <em>a little bit</em> to do with those other things, but I slowly, painfully, realized that yes, indeed, the coffee was making my eyes twitch.</p>
<p>Coffee had caused my problems before -- anxiety, insomnia, heart palpitations -- and I had quit drinking it. Then I would strat drinking it again, slowly, tentatively, then, like a lover, with full blown gross obsession. But the eye twitching was too much. It was just so annoying. So I decided to quit again.</p>
<p>There really wasnt any good replacement for the taste of coffee. I love tea, but when I want coffee, tea just doesn't do it. And Decaf was still making my eyes twitch. My friend Cody at Home Ec Workshop in town told me about chicory, and people, CHICORY Â IS THE ANSWER.</p>
<p>I brew it drip style in a single cup. Add in 2.5 teaspoons of Chicory and 1 teaspoon of dandelion root. The dandelion root clears out your liver and it adds an awesome sweetness to the brew. Today I added unsweetened baking cocoa to the mix and found this: Chicory Hot Chocolate. It is so good! No caffeine except the cocoa, and no sugar. Try it. Here are the steps:</p>
