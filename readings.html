HELLO THERE
<p>
Hi! I’m Lauren Haldeman. I am the author of the poetry collection Calenday (Rescue Press, 2014). I work as the web developer, web designer and editor for this website, as well as several other websites, including the Writing University website at the University of Iowa and the Iowa Review. I received my M.F.A. from the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, and have been a finalist for the Walt Whitman award and the Colorado Prize for Poetry. Also: I’m a mom and make paintings.

HERE’S WHAT I LOOK LIKE
